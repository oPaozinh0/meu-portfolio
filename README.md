![CV Preview](https://i.imgur.com/fvIQp4q.png)

## üöÄ About This Project

This is my personal CV, developed to showcase my skills and experience as a Fullstack Developer. The application was built with the **Laravel** framework on the backend and **Tailwind CSS** with **Vite** for the frontend, resulting in a modern, responsive, and high-performance page.

The site features a clean design, a theme switcher (light/dark), and multi-language support (Portuguese and English), all handled dynamically on the client-side with JavaScript.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Theme Switcher:** Toggle between light and dark modes, with the user's preference saved in their browser.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Content is available in both Portuguese and English, with a dynamic language switcher that doesn't require a page reload.
- **Subtle Animations:** Utilizes the `AOS` library for on-scroll animations that enhance the user experience.
- **SEO Optimized:** Dynamic meta tags for better search engine visibility and social media sharing.
